# Directory Sorter

`Directory Sorter` is a simple Python application that helps you organize files in a directory by sorting them into folders based on their file extensions. This project uses the `tkinter` library to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

## Features

- **Directory Selection**: Select a directory to sort using a user-friendly GUI.
- **File Organization**: Automatically sorts files into folders based on their file extensions.
- **No Extension Handling**: Files without an extension are moved to a folder named `no_extension`.

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python directory_sorter.py
A window will appear, allowing you to select a directory.
Once selected, the program will automatically sort the files into folders based on their extensions.
Requirements
Python 3.x
tkinter (usually included with Python installations)
